#### App User Private Key File
When using App User class ``BoxAppUser`, you must create 2 files : private_key.pem and public_key.pem. Put private key file in the root of application, for Laravel project this should be fine because outside public folder.


#### Laravel 5
There are some configuration key to set in folder 

``config/boxapi.php`` and don't forget if you set private key file in root folder. Set this 

	'private_key_file'  => base_path() . '/private_key.pem'

#### Laravel 4

Configuration file will be put on folder 

``app\config\packages\maengkom\boxapi\config.php``

also like Laravel 5, you may set private key file in the root project folder

	'private_key_file'  => base_path() . '/private_key.pem'

#### Lumen
Configuration integrated in .env file, use the key below and find the values in you box app. Follow guideline in http://developer.box.com 

```
BOX_AU_CLIENT_ID	 		=
BOX_AU_CLIENT_SECRET   		=
BOX_REDIRECT_URI			=
BOX_ENTERPRISE_ID			=
BOX_APP_USER_NAME			=
BOX_APP_USER_ID				=
BOX_EXPIRATION				= 60
BOX_KID_VALUE				=
BOX_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE		= private_key.pem
BOX_PASSPHRASE				= 1234

        'kid_value'			=> '',
        'passphrase'		=> '',
        'expiration'		=> 60,
        'private_key_file'	=> 'private_key.pem',
